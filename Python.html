    <p>Python, created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language. It's celebrated for its emphasis on code readability, employing a clear and intuitive syntax that often resembles the English language, making it especially beginner-friendly. This readability is further enhanced by its reliance on indentation to define code blocks, rather than semicolons or brackets, contributing to a cleaner and more structured coding style.</p>
