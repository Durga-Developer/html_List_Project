    <p>MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It stands out for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use, making it a favorite among developers for a wide range of applications. Instead of traditional tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents within collections. </p>
