    <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It adheres to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, encouraging developers to reuse code and avoid redundancy. Known for its "batteries included" philosophy, Django provides a comprehensive set of features and tools out-of-the-box, covering common web development needs such as user authentication, URL routing, database interaction, and template rendering. </p>
