    <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic content to websites. It's a core component of web development, working alongside HTML and CSS to create engaging user experiences. Beyond web development, JavaScript can be used for server-side development (with Node.js), mobile app development, and even game development. </p>
