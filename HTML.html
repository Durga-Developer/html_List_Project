    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the internet. 
        It isn’t a programming language—it doesn’t “run” like code—but instead defines the layout and elements of web pages. 
        HTML uses tags to mark different types of content, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
        These tags are interpreted by browsers to display information visually and logically. The latest version, HTML5, 
        supports audio, video, and richer interactions, making websites more dynamic and accessible. HTML works hand-in-hand with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity,
         forming the holy trinity of front-end web development. Simple to learn, universal in use—HTML is where every web project begins.</p>
